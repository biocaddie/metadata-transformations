  "digestion": "Ammonium bicarbonate (50 mM) was added to achieve a final methanol concentration of 20% and the samples were digested with Trypsin Gold (Promega, Madison, WI) at a protein to enzyme ratio of 50:1 (w/w) at 37Â°C for 6 h. The samples were dried in a SpeedVac and resuspended in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate prior to LC-MS analysis.",
