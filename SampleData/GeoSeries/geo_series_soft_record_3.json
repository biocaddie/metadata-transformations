Then RNA sequence was generated by using the Illumina system.\nResults: Using an optimized data analysis workflow, we mapped about 13 million sequence reads per sample to the mouse genome and identified about 14,500 transcripts in the macrophage mRNAs. Among them, 719 and 286 genes were differentially expressed in 15d-PGJ2 and 15d-PGJ2-PC group respectively.\nConclusions: Deoxy-A2/J2-IsoP-PC are a novel series of oxidation products we identified in atherosclerotic plaques. 15d-PGJ2-PC is a representative compound of these oxidation products we chemically synthesised. Using RNA-seq technology, we provided 15d-PGJ2-PC induced gene expression profile and could contribute to  study the roles of these novel oxidation products in the atherosclerosis."},
