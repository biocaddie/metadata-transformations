One of the primary concerns of this international seminar was the need for cooperation in the development of data resources in order to facilitate exchange of data between individual scholars and research groups. This data collection contains returns for all elections for 3,143 counties of 50 states of the United States to the offices of president, senator and representative, and governor, ecological data drawn from various United States censuses from 1947 to 1965, and selected data from the 1952 National Council of Churches Survey of church membership. It contains a merged set of data at the county, state, and congressional district levels for the 1950s and 1960s. The data are organized in three parts: (1) election returns and ecological data in raw form, (2) percentagized party votes and ecological data, and (3) series of derived measures and additional computations. Data on election returns include votes for the Democratic and Republican parties, as well as for other minor parties for the period 1949-1968. Data on ecology provide information on total population, urbanization, industries, housing, and sex and age distribution. Other demographic variables include education, religion, employment, and income."},
