    "description": "These data contain a record of neuron spiking activity in rat hippocampal dissociated cultures.\n                The recordings were performed for days in vitro (DIV) 6 through 35 with all cultures being\n                recorded multiple times throughout development. The recordings were performed with a large\n                multielectrode array (Multichannel Systems, square lattice, 60 electrodes, 200 μm interelectrode\n                spacing, 30 μm electrode diameter, flat electrodes). The cultures were not stimulated, so these\n                data represent spontaneous activity. In total, 435 recordings are provided, most of which possess\n                about one hundred neurons (min: 3, max: 142, mean: 91, total: 39,529). The average firing\n                rate of the neurons was 1.9 Hz. The data were binned at 20 kHz and are presented in units of\n                bins (0.05 ms). The lengths of the recordings were approximately 1 hour."
