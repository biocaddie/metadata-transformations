This strain was generated by nine cycles of cross-intercross breeding of diabetes-prone DP with DR BB rats. Iddm 1 in the BioBreeding (BB) rat designates the genomic region on rat Chromosome (Chr) 4 that harbors the gene causing peripheral T cell lymphopenia (Lyp) and diabetes. The average age of onset of diabetes was 85 1 53 days of age after the first and 67 1 10 days of age after the 9th cycle."},
