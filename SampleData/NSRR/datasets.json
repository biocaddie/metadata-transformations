  "description": "One of the largest population-based pediatric cohorts studied with objective sleep studies, and probably one with the largest minority representation. The cohort includes 907 children, studied at ages 8-11 years with in-home sleep studies, acoustic reflectometry, anthropometry, spirometry, blood pressure (BP), and neuropschology (NP) and behavioral assessments. The cohort is a stratified random sample of full-term (FT) and preterm (PT) children, born between 1988-1993, identified from the birth records of 3 Cleveland area hospitals.",
