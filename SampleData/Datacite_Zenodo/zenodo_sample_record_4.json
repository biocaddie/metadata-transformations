    "description": "<p><strong>American Labor Who's Who dataset, version 2.2.0<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>A dataset derived from the digitized text of Solon de Leon, et al., <em>The American Labor Who's Who<\/em> (New York: Hanford Press, 1925). This release includes separate files the U.S. and \"Other Countries\" sections of the directory.<\/p>\n\n<p>The American Labor Who's Who (ALWW), published in 1925, is a directory of activists in the fields of trade unionism, immigrant rights, civil liberties, progressive and radical politics. The directory includes roughly 1,300 entries for U.S. activists and 300 additional non-US activists. Each entry is a telegraphic biography. Some provide only name, professional title and address at the time of publication, but many sketch rich life histories. Nearly all provide details on birth date and place, family background, education, migration, and work histories, as well as key organizations, events publications, home and work addresses.<\/p>\n\n<p>The ALWW dataset is derived from the text hosted on the HathiTrust digital library: https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000591300. Faculty, staff, and students at UCLA corrected the plain text from the scanned document and parsed the text into comma-separated fields. This release includes separate files for US entries and \"Other Countries\" entries. About 30 individuals are listed in the US section with the notation \"see other countries,\" mainly Canadians and Mexicans. This subset is also in a separate file in this release.<\/p>\n\n<p>For more information about this and related projects see: http://socialjusticehistory.org/projects/networkedlabor/.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Contributors<\/strong> Tobias Higbie, Principal Investigator, UCLA History Department Craig Messner, UCLA Center for Digital Humanities Nick de Carlo, UCLA Center for Digital Humanities Zoe Borovsky, UCLA Library<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Contents of Release<\/strong> The US and Other Country datasets were developed separately as reflected in their different version numbers.
