These coronary artery disease patients (271 patients) had positive angiogram (at least one vessel narrowing >75%) and either exercise induced ischemia or evidence of previous myocardial infarction. These patients were in stable phase of ischemic heart disease since they were enrolled at least 2 month after their event. The Electrocardiograms were acquired using three pseudo-orthogonal lead configuration (X, Y and Z). There is a initial resting supine period for a 20 minutes duration before starting the ambulatory recording.\r\n\r\nAll patients are suppose to be in sinus rhythm. Only cardiac patients without evidence of congestive heart failure were included."},
