    "description": "This volume contains a portion of digitized reels of raw footage stored at the Drs. Nicholas and Dorothy Cummings Center for the History of Psychology documenting Arnold Gesell\u2019s research, dating from the 1910s through the 1940s. The collection includes films of infants and children performing tasks that had not previously been captured in moving images. Many of the filmed tasks represent Gesell\u2019s \u201cstages\" of development, such as infants learning to roll over, using a spoon, stacking blocks, or manipulating rings and pellets. We are continuing to add clips to this volume on a continuous basis.\n\nSharing of this material with anyone other than the authorized researcher and his or her immediate collaborators requires permission from The Cummings Center for the History of Psychology. Requests for sharing will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Please contact ahap@uakron.edu for the Access Policy and Permission to Use Moving Images."
