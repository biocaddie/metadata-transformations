    "description": "Four-month-old infants and their parents were video-recorded in the Face-to-Face/Still-Face (FFSF) procedure (Adamson & Frick, 2003). Infants sat in a seat and their parents sat across from them. Parents and infants engaged in 2 minutes of natural positive interaction, then 2 minutes of parent still-face in which parents were asked to not respond to their infants, and then 2 minutes of renewed interaction. At 12 months, these infants and parents then completed the Strange Situation to assess attachment security, which consists of a series of separations and reunions."
